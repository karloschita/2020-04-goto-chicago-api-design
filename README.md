Repo for the 2020-04 GOTO Chicago "API Design" Masterclass 

_I'll be posting prep material here each day in the run-up to the masterclass later this week._

### Class Prep
We'll be working on exercises and class assignments throughout the sessions. To make sure you're ready for the projects, read through the [Installing](2020-04-installing.md) document for details on how to get your workstation/laptop set up for the masterclass.

### API Stories
You'll find a list of sample stories in the [/stories](stories/README.md) folder. You'll also find a template [API Story Builder](stories/api-story-builder.md). 

### API Diagrams
